### Building a Container Image Using [Google Kaniko Container](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) on [Containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) Runtime 

Containerd is an open source container runtime that provides an industry-standard container execution environment for running containers. It is designed to be lightweight, portable, and extensible. With the help of Googleâ€™s Kaniko container, you can now build and push container images to a Docker registry without having to install Docker. Here we show how to build(and push a container) image on Containerd runtime using Google Kaniko container.


#### Pre-requisite
We need to have containerd installed. Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) to install containerd.

If we have a k8s cluster - we can run the container build process as a pod(Optional).

#### Install [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)

Nerdctl is a command line tool for managing containers on Containerd. It allows you to create, delete, start, stop, and inspect containers. To install Nerdctl, run the following commands: 

```bash 
wget https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases/download/v1.2.0/nerdctl-1.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar Cxzvvf /usr/local/bin nerdctl-1.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm nerdctl-1.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

With nerdctl in place - we would need a `Dockerfile` which dictates what we want containerize. Let's use the following sample `Dockerfile`. We expect the `Dockerfile` to be present in the project root directory.

```bash 
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo hello"]
```

With the docker file in place - lets trigger container build process by running the `gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor` container. Also, we are assuming our current working directory as the project root directory for the following example:

```bash
sudo nerdctl run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor \
  --tar-path=/workspace/image.tar --no-push --destination /workspace
```

In the above build - we not pushing the image to docker registry. We are simply generating image tar file to our current working directory(/workspace inside the container). We do a directory listing - we can see the `image.tar` file in our current directory.



sudo nerdctl run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -v ~/.docker/config.json:/workspace/config.json --env DOCKER_CONFIG=/workspace gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor -d [USER ACCPOUNT]/[IMAGE]:[TAG] -v debug
