### Building a Container Image Using [Google Kaniko Container](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) on [Containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) Runtime 

Containerd is an open source container runtime that provides an industry-standard container execution environment for running containers. It is designed to be lightweight, portable, and extensible. With the help of Googleâ€™s Kaniko container, you can now build and push container images to a Docker registry(or any other) without having to install Docker. Here we show how to build(and push a container) image on Containerd runtime using Google Kaniko container.


#### Pre-requisite
We need to have containerd installed. Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) to install containerd.

If we have a k8s cluster - we can run the container build process as a pod(Optional).

#### Install [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)

Nerdctl is a command line tool for managing containers on Containerd. It allows you to create, delete, start, stop, and inspect containers. To install Nerdctl, run the following commands: 

```bash 
wget https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases/download/v1.2.0/nerdctl-1.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar Cxzvvf /usr/local/bin nerdctl-1.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm nerdctl-1.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

With nerdctl in place - we would need a `Dockerfile` which dictates what we want containerize. Let's use the following sample `Dockerfile`. We expect the `Dockerfile` to be present in the project root directory.

```bash 
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo hello"]
```

#### Push to docker registry lauching kaniko container

With the docker file in place - lets trigger container build process by running the `gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor` container. Also, we are assuming our current working directory as the project root directory for the following example:

```bash
sudo nerdctl run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -v ~/.docker/config.json:/workspace/config.json \
--env DOCKER_CONFIG=/workspace gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor -d ratulb/echo:1.0.0 -v debug
```

-  The command starts by using `nerdctl` to launch the `gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor` container in containerd. This container is used to create and push a container image to a Docker registry. 

-  The command then mounts the current working directory `(pwd)` to the workspace directory inside the container. This allows the executor to access any files or directories that are needed for building and pushing the image. 

-  The command also mounts the user's Docker configuration file (`config.json`) into the workspace directory inside the container. This allows Kaniko to authenticate with the Docker registry when pushing images. 

-  The command then sets an environment variable, `DOCKER_CONFIG`, which points to the mounted `config.json` file in order for Kaniko to use it for authentication purposes. 

-  Finally, the command specifies that Kaniko should build and push an image with tag `ratulb/echo:1.1.1` and run in debug mode so that more detailed output is provided during execution of Kaniko commands.

Now we can launch the container:

```bash
sudo nerdctl run ratulb/echo:1.1.1
hello
```
**We can also place the generated container to a local archive without pushing it to any registry:**

```bash
sudo nerdctl run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor
  --tar-path=/workspace/image.tar --no-push --destination /workspace -v debug
```

We need to provide the `--tar-path` and `--no-push` flags for that.

#### Push to docker registry lauching kaniko as a pod in k8s cluster

We can also run kaniko as one-shot container to build our container and push it to docker registry. For that - we would need to create a `local storage` volume in our k8s cluster and make that volume available to `kaniko` pod via `volume claim`. Also, we would need create a docker registry secret and provide it to `kaniko` pod so that it can authenticate with docker registry to push to created container. We detail the steps below:
